# Git Cheat Sheet  
By Fabio Pacific  

Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers, including Andre, collaborate on projects of any scale.  
Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git was designed to manage the development of the Linux kernel.

## What is a Distributed Version Control System?  
A distributed version control system helps you keep track of changes made to files in your project. This change history lives on your local machine and lets you revert to a previous version of your project if needed.  
Git makes collaboration easy. Each team member has a full backup of the repository locally, and using an external server like BitBucket, GitHub, or GitLab, they can safely store the repository in one place.  
By using Git, different members of the team can copy the repository locally and track changes made by everyone.
